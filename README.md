# Foundry DeFi Stablecoin

This is a smart contract written in solidity and thoroughly built and tested with foundry.


# About

This project is meant to be a stablecoin where users can deposit WETH and WBTC in exchange for a token that will be pegged to the USD.

Some key notes:
1. The (Relative Stability) is  Anchored or Pegged to $1.00
2. Stability Mechanism (Minting) is  Algorithmic (Decentralized)
   -People can only mint the stablecoin with enough collateral(coded)
3. Collateral Allowed: Exogenous (Crypto)
  1. wETH
  2. wBTC

# Getting Started

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `forge --version` and you see a response like `forge 0.2.0 (816e00b 2023-03-16T00:05:26.396218Z)`

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/FrankezeCode/DeFi-Stablecoin
cd foundry-defi-stablecoin-cu
forge build
```


# Updates

- The latest version of openzeppelin-contracts has changes in the ERC20Mock file. To follow along , you need to install version 4.8.3 which can be done by `forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@v4.8.3 --no-commit` instead of `forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts --no-commit`

# Usage

## Start a local node

```
make anvil
```

## Deploy

This will default to your local node. You need to have it running in another terminal in order for it to deploy.

```
make deploy
```

## Deploy - Other Network

[See below](#deployment-to-a-testnet-or-mainnet)

## Testing

I performed the following test

1. Unit
2. Integration
3. Forked
4. Staging

In this repo  I also performed  Fuzzing.

```
forge test
```

### Test Coverage

```
For coverage based testing:
The test coverage is  87% for the stable coin engine . 
 -( more test would be covered as time progresses.)
```



```
forge coverage --report debug
```

# Deployment to a testnet or mainnet

1. Setup environment variables

You'll want to set your `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` as environment variables. You can add them to a `.env` file, similar to what you see in `.env.example`.

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your account (like from [metamask](https://metamask.io/)). **NOTE:** FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
  - You can [learn how to export it here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).
- `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: This is url of the sepolia testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

Optionally, add your `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` if you want to verify your contract on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).

1. Get testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some testnet ETH. You should see the ETH show up in your metamask.

2. Deploy

```
make deploy ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

## Scripts

Instead of scripts, we can directly use the `cast` command to interact with the contract.

For example, on Sepolia:

1. Get some WETH

```
cast send 0xdd13E55209Fd76AfE204dBda4007C227904f0a81 "deposit()" --value 0.1ether --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

2. Approve the WETH

```
cast send 0xdd13E55209Fd76AfE204dBda4007C227904f0a81 "approve(address,uint256)" 0x091EA0838eBD5b7ddA2F2A641B068d6D59639b98 1000000000000000000 --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

3. Deposit and Mint DSC

```
cast send 0x091EA0838eBD5b7ddA2F2A641B068d6D59639b98 "depositCollateralAndMintDsc(address,uint256,uint256)" 0xdd13E55209Fd76AfE204dBda4007C227904f0a81 100000000000000000 10000000000000000 --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

## Estimate gas

You can estimate how much gas things cost by running:

```
forge snapshot
```

And you'll see an output file called `.gas-snapshot`

# Formatting

To run code formatting:

```
forge fmt
```

# Slither

```
slither :; slither . --config-file slither.config.json
```

# Additional Info:
Some users were having a confusion that whether Chainlink-brownie-contracts is an official Chainlink repository or not. Here is the info.
Chainlink-brownie-contracts is an official repo. The repository is owned and maintained by the chainlink team for this very purpose, and gets releases from the proper chainlink release process. You can see it's still the `smartcontractkit` org as well.

https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts

## Let's talk about what "Official" means
The "official" release process is that chainlink deploys it's packages to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts). So technically, even downloading directly from `smartcontractkit/chainlink` is wrong, because it could be using unreleased code.

So, then you have two options:

1. Download from NPM and have your codebase have dependencies foreign to foundry
2. Download from the chainlink-brownie-contracts repo which already downloads from npm and then packages it nicely for you to use in foundry.
## Summary
1. That is an official repo maintained by the same org
2. It downloads from the official release cycle `chainlink/contracts` use (npm) and packages it nicely for digestion from foundry.
